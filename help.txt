Components:

Weather Class:


Initialization: Sets up variables for latitude, longitude, and API ID.
User Interaction: Provides options for users to check live weather, change location, or exit.
Location Handling:
Fetches the current location automatically using geocoder based on IP address.
Allows users to enter a location manually if automatic retrieval fails.
Weather Retrieval: Fetches weather data based on the provided coordinates using OpenWeatherMap API.
Air_Quality Class (Subclass of Weather):


Inherits Weather class functionalities.
Initialization: Inherits Weather class's initialization to set up latitude, longitude, and API ID.
Air Quality Retrieval: Fetches air quality data based on the provided coordinates using OpenWeatherMap API.
Summary:
The project allows users to interactively access weather and air quality information.
It utilizes APIs from OpenWeatherMap for weather and air quality data.
Provides flexibility for users to input their location manually or fetch it automatically.
Handles errors during location retrieval and displays appropriate messages.
Improvements:
Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide more detailed error messages for user guidance.
UI Enhancement: Consider implementing a graphical interface for better user interaction and visual presentation.
Optimization: Refactor code for better modularity and readability, possibly breaking down functionalities into smaller, more manageable methods.

problems arrived:
1)train api not working after covid
2)in learning about api and how to handle request
3)automatic location detection not getting accurate location
